Hello! I am a scientist working at the intersection of <strong>materials science</strong>, <strong>informatics</strong>, and <strong>high-performance computing</strong>. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of <strong>[Kristin Persson](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/)</strong> at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Much of my research focuses on leveraging physical symmetries and informatics based tools to help in the computational design and discovery of new materials. I am also actively involved in the development of the <strong>[Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)</strong>.

Listed here are <strong>[software packages](/code/)</strong> I have contributed to and <strong>[articles](/publications/)</strong> I have published as part of my research. For more details about my work, please see my full <strong>[cv](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf)</strong>.
